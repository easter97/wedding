			<p><span class="dropcap">Memories are fuzzy</span> on when exactly we first met. Volney believes we initially met at dinner after one of his soccer games, while I maintain we met at our friends Nic and Henry's townhome.</p>
			<p>Nic and Henry always spoke very highly of Vol and I knew I had to meet the man behind the legend. We started to see each other more through mutual friends and I knew he was something special. Credit is due to Nic who invited me to play mini golf with a group of his friends, Volney included, and not-so-subtley dropped in the fact Volney was single. When Volney moved in with Nic, Henry, and Jonathan I spent even more time in his company and started to feel a spark between us. After a couple of weeks of shameless flirting, Marae finally put us into a group message and suggested a double date. We went to another mini golf course where Volney convinced the bartender to let him 'win' a free drink to impress his date.</p>
			<p>We scheduled another date, just the two of us this time, and when I realized Volney hadn't seen all of the Harry Potter movies we ordered a pizza, cracked open some Big Waves, and got to work burning through 8 movies. The more time we spent together, the harder it was to be apart. Volney asked me to be his girlfriend on June 19th, 4 days after my 24th birthday and 2 weeks after we first started seeing eachother. The rest is history.</p>
