      <main><aside>How we met</aside>
        <p><span class="dropcap">Memories are fuzzy</span> on when exactly we first met. Volney believes we initially met at dinner after one of his soccer games, while I maintain we met at our friends Nic and Henry's townhome.</p>
        <p>Nic and Henry always spoke very highly of Vol and I knew I had to meet the man behind the legend. We started to see each other more through mutual friends and I knew he was something special. Credit is due to Nic who invited me to play mini golf with a group of his friends, Volney included, and not-so-subtley dropped in the fact Volney was single. When Volney moved in with Nic, Henry, and Jonathan I spent even more time in his company and started to feel a spark between us. After a couple of weeks of shameless flirting, Marae finally put us into a group message and suggested a double date. We went to another mini golf course where Volney convinced the bartender to let him 'win' a free drink to impress his date.</p>
        <p>We scheduled another date, just the two of us this time, and when I realized Volney hadn't seen all of the Harry Potter movies we ordered a pizza, cracked open some Big Waves, and got to work burning through 8 movies. The more time we spent together, the harder it was to be apart. Volney asked me to be his girlfriend on June 19th, 4 days after my 24th birthday and 2 weeks after we first started seeing eachother. The rest is history.</p>

      <main><aside>the proposal</aside>
        <p><span class="dropcap">We designed the ring</span> together before our trip to Europe. We knew it wouldn't be ready for that vacation and it was important to Volney to have the ring we designed together when he proposed. Through all of the beauty of Switzerland and Italy he wished he could have proposed in the most majestic places we had ever seen, so we knew it was going to take something truly special for this proposal.</p>
        <p>Amanda suspected the day might be right due to Volney's more-than-usual enthusiastic participation in her idea to have a picnic to watch the solar eclipse. The sky was cloudy that morning and it seemed doubtful the eclipse would be visible. Fortunately, as the afternoon heat burned off the clouds it made for perfect conditions for our picnic. Amanda set up the camera and blanket while Volney grabbed charcuterie from the store and chilled two of the bottles of rose we had picked out together in Italy. We watched with our neighbors as the moon slowly covered the sun and the world went dark, a truly awe inspiring experience. It was there, with the giant ring slowly disappearing from the sky that Volney presented a ring of his own.</p>
        <p>A promise of love, commitment, and a lifetime of adventures together.</p>
