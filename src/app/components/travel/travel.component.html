                    <p>If you would like to attend any of the wedding events prior to the ceremony, we recommend landing by 3pm to allow time for travel and settling in at the resort. You can view the schedule of wedding weekend events on the events page of this site. </p>
                    <p>If you are arriving the day of the wedding we highly recommend you select a morning flight to allow for any difficulties or delays.</p>
